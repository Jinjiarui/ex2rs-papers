# Paper Collection of Explainable Recommender System

This is a collection of research and review papers of explainable recommender system. Several explaination techniques related papers on natural language processing and multimedia are also listed here due to high correlation. All the papers are sorted by time. **Any suggestions and pull requests are more than welcome**.

The sharing principle of these references here is for research. If any authors do not want their paper to be listed here, please feel free to contact [Jiarui Jin](http://Jinjiarui.github.io/) (Email: jinjiarui97 [AT] gmail.com).
